# 👋🏽 Welcome to my Github Profile!
<p> 
  My name is Jermy Francisco. I like to build and design stuff — on paper and for the web.
  For over 5 years, I have been building dynamic data models, mapping out workflows, and 
  preparing documentation. Although my previous career involved a heavy focus on Excel, I taught 
  myself Python and SQL in order to take this passion further.

myself as a programmer — I'd love to know!
